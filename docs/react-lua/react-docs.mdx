# React Documentation

How do you find further documentation on React?

## Why is there no API documentation for `react-lua`?

Because `react-lua` is a transpilation of React, the API is the same as React. The only difference is that the API is in Lua instead of JavaScript/TypeScript.

React is agnostic of the rendering engine, and needs specific implementations (renderers) to work on different platforms. It is for this reason that [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
uses the same React Core as [React DOM](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom) (the browser-based DOM renderer), but has a different renderer.

Similarly, `react-lua` has the [react-roblox](https://github.com/jsdotlua/react-lua/tree/main/packages/react-roblox) renderer for integration with the Roblox DOM / API.

## React Docs

The current React documentation is available at [react.dev](https://react.dev/).
`react-lua` is based on React 17, so the documentation for that version is the most relevant.

As `react-lua` is a port of React, the documentation for React is also applicable to `react-lua`.

For example, for `useEffect`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Page({ user }) {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');

  useEffect(() => {
    const { firstName, lastName } = user;
    setPerson(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
  }, [user]);

    ...
};

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lua" label="Luau">

```lua

local React = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.React)

local useState, useEffect = React.useState, React.useEffect

local function Page(props)

    local person, setPerson = useState('Alice')

    useEffect(function()
        local firstName, lastName = props.user.firstName, props.user.lastName
        setPerson(firstName .. ' ' .. lastName)
    end, { props.user })

    ...
end

return Page

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Caveats

The following are _not_ implemented in `react-lua` (as they weren't introduced in React 17, although there are other features that are not implemented):

- [Suspense / useSuspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)
- [Transitions / useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition)
- [useDeferredValue](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) and [useSyncExternalStore](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)
- [useInsertionEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useInsertionEffect)
